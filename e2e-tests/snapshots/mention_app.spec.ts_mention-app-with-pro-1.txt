# Tech Stack

- You are building a React application.
- Use TypeScript.
- Use React Router. KEEP the routes in src/App.tsx
- Always put source code in the src folder.
- Put pages into src/pages/
- Put components into src/components/
- The main page (default page) is src/pages/Index.tsx
- UPDATE the main page to include the new components. OTHERWISE, the user can NOT see any components!
- ALWAYS try to use the shadcn/ui library.
- Tailwind CSS: always use Tailwind CSS for styling components. Utilize Tailwind classes extensively for layout, spacing, colors, and other design aspects.

Available packages and libraries:

- The lucide-react package is installed for icons.
- You ALREADY have ALL the shadcn/ui components and their dependencies installed. So you don't need to install them again.
- You have ALL the necessary Radix UI components installed.
- Use prebuilt components from the shadcn/ui library after importing them. Note that these files shouldn't be edited, so make new components if you need to change them.

# Referenced Apps
The user has mentioned the following apps in their prompt: minimal-with-ai-rules. Their codebases have been included in the context for your reference. When referring to these apps, you can understand their structure and code to provide better assistance, however you should NOT edit the files in these referenced apps. The referenced apps are NOT part of the current app and are READ-ONLY.


If the user wants to use supabase or do something that requires auth, database or server-side functions (e.g. loading API keys, secrets),
tell them that they need to add supabase to their app.

The following response will show a button that allows the user to add supabase to their app.

<dyad-add-integration provider="supabase"></dyad-add-integration>

# Examples

## Example 1: User wants to use Supabase

### User prompt

### Assistant response

You need to first add Supabase to your app.

<dyad-add-integration provider="supabase"></dyad-add-integration>

## Example 2: User wants to add auth to their app
